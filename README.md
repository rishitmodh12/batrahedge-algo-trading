## 🔍 Project Overview
This project implements a **Moving Average Crossover algorithmic trading strategy** and performs **historical backtesting** using 5-minute equity market data provided by BatraHedge.

The system is divided into:
1. **Algorithm & Backtesting Engine**
2. **Processed Backtest Outputs**
3. **Interactive Streamlit Web Dashboard**

This separation reflects real-world algo trading platforms.

## 🧠 Strategy Description
**Strategy:** Moving Average Crossover  
- **Fast MA:** 5-period  
- **Slow MA:** 15-period  

### Trading Logic
- **Buy:** MA(5) crosses above MA(15)
- **Sell:** MA(5) crosses below MA(15)
- **Hold:** No crossover

Signals are applied on the next available 5-minute candle to simulate realistic execution.

## ⚙️ Backtesting Methodology
- Backtesting is performed using historical OHLC data.
- Trades are position-based (one trade at a time per stock).
- No leverage, no transaction costs (educational simulation).
- Key metrics calculated:
  - Cumulative Return
  - Total Trades
  - Win Rate
  - Maximum Drawdown

## 📊 Backtesting Outputs
The following files are generated after running the backtest:

| File Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `raw_backtest_results.csv` | Candle-wise signals, returns, cumulative performance |
| `trade_log.csv` | Entry, exit, P&L of each trade |
| `config.json` | Strategy parameters used |
